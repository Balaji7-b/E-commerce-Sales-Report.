# E-commerce-Sales-Report.
I recently completed an E-commerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI. This report analyzes sales, profit, top customers, payment modes, and regional performance. Key takeaway: despite 20K sales, the business runs at a loss of -1144, highlighting the importance of profit analysis. Sharing my work here â€“ feedback welcome!
